                    <p>Hello, My name is Ryan Conran.  I was born in Minnetonka MN, and have lived
                        there my whole life.  I attended and graduated from Winona State University for My higher education
                        with an emphasis in Business Administration.  After graduation I did temp work at 
                        Optum, before my first non temporary position at SPS Commerce.    
                    </p>

                    <p>During my time at SPS Commerce I worked in their finacial department
                        and assisted customers with billing related inquires.  I used salesforce to comlete
                        this task and ocassionally, due to my messy typing, I would accidently open 
                        developer tools on my browser.  Sometimes I would look through the html that would pop up
                        on my screen and be able to pick out one or two things that translated from the code to the 
                        actual page I was looking at.  It was at times like these I often thought about becoming more knowledgeable
                        the process of coding.
                    </p>

                    <p>I spent an extrodinarly long time weighing the decision to pursue further education,
                        or to keep my current position at SPS Commerce.  I came to the decision that I wanted
                        to pursue a different career path and took the leap!  I am eager to continue learing about 
                        coding languages and hope that I can make my career dreams a reality.  
                    </p>
